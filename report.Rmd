<!-- 1. Reasoning -->

<!-- People living within or nearby forest are among the poorest in the world, not only in monetary income, but at multiple levels of their lives (e.g. health assistance - CIT, o que mais???). This population is mostly invisible to authorities (???) and policies (CIT), partially due to the remoteness of they housing and also to the lack of political power. Forest-proximate people are often targets of land-grabbing, for example, and lose their land through many other mechanisms, such as disposession by large landowners and land investors, or abandonment during climatic shocks (e.g. droughts or floods) or even in search of better lives elsewhere. Quantifying the number of people  proximate to forests is a first and necessary step to design policies aiming sustainable development of those communities. an attempt to quantify the number of forest-proximate people was made by Newton et al, but they explicitly (???) set aside dryland forest areas due to ... Here we build a case-study to explore the challenges in quantifyig FPP in a dryland forest, but also to evaluate the population-forest dynamics in relation to change in land equity. -->

## 1. Objective one: Measuring the Caatinga’s forest cover and censusing the Caatinga’s forest-proximate population
```{r include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
```

<br/>

### 1.1 - Where in the Caatinga is it reasonable to define forested areas?
```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img/fig.forest_nvc.jpg"))

```

<br/>

### 1.2 How many forest-proximate people are there? and sensitive is this to the method of defining forest, proximity(?), or population estimates?

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img/fig_fpp.jpg"))

```
Brown dots and line are the number of Forest proximate people considering all types of vegetation in Caatinga dry forest and the green dots and line considering only the mapbiomas' forest vegetation

<br/>

## 1.3 What is the trajectory of change over time, (including influence of method) and does population change vary geographically?
```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img/map.fpp_change.jpg"))
```
<br/>

## 2. Objective 2: Understanding the linkages between population change and changing forest coverage

### 2.1 - What is the relationship between rural population size change and changing forest cover?
```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img/fig.fpp_nvc.jpg"))
```

### 2.2 what kinds of frontier advance (or reforestation areas) can we identity? what kinds of forest regeneration can we identify?

####  - Off-farm livelihoos: Gain in forest cover and population. People are still living in farm, but producing less, either by better wages in nearby towns (e.g. industries or service sectors) or social assistance (e.g. bolsa família)

####  - Land abandonment: gain in forest cover but losing people. People leaving rural areas probably due to shocks, either climatic (e.g. drought) or economic (e.g. end of economic cycle)

####  - Small-holders settlements: Loses in forest cover but gain in population size. Possibly a populist frontier where families are settled in previously depopulated area or a simple increase in rural families size

####  - Dispossession: Loss in forest cover and population. Probably an advance of capitalist frontier, where larger landholders buy small agricultural family farms for investment and commodity production. Other phenomenon such desertification, can also cause de forest-people change pattern.

```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img/map_category_change.jpg"))
```

<br/>

### 2.3. in which situation the social vulnerability (measured by the number of families under social assistance programes - CADUNICO) increase?

<br/>

### 2.4 censusing the number of municipalities, people and forest cover in each of these 4 kinds of municipality
